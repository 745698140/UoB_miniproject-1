Notes from trading and exchanges by Larry Harris

- Trading is a zero sum gmae
- Instruments are fungible if one unit is indistinguishable from one another. This facilitates markets as a buyer is able to buy at the lowest price offerred by a seller.

Key Recurrent Themes:
1. Information asymmtries, well informed traders profit over those who arent. Who is buying what? How are orders fulfilled? Large orders are harder to fill all at once.
2. Options
3. Externalities, most importantly *order flow externatlity* - traders who offer to trade give other traders valuable options to trade for which the offerers are not compensated. 
4. Market structure - consists of trading rules. **always consider what effects market structure has on trading strategies**
5. Competition with free entry and exit. Trading strats that generate large profits attract traders who want to participate in those profits. This lowers the profits everyone makes on average. 
6. Communitcaton adn computing tech
7. Price correlations - markets for similar instruments are closely related, and compete for each other for order flow.
8. Prinicipal-agent problems arise when agents do what they want to do rather than ehat their principals want them to do.
9. Trust and creditworthiness. People are trustworthy when they do what they say they will, theyre creditworthy when they can do what they say they can do.
10. Zero-sum game - winnings on one side equal the losses on the other
