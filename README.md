- **The difference between mid-price and micro-price**

    For liquid stocks, the difference is trivial. For illiquid stocks, the difference is non-trivial.

    Models and features are differentiated for these two types.So, we need to calcualte the liquidity of each stock firstly.

- **Data normalisation**

   remove outliners, eg transaction recorded outside official training time.
   Don't foreget to normalise features

- **Can we skip to sample examples without considering time series?**

    we can do it if the previous time series don't affect the price movements. Or we can sample the previous k steps with the examples.

- **What is our input, LOB or transaction events?**
